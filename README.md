# DevOps-Practice

Welcome to my personal playground
 
I've added several folders to this repo to represent 
some basic examples of how to use some common open-source DevOps tools.

I use it mainly as a quick refresher and written reminder 
for things I've tried/learned/done and then forgot about.

Enjoy!
